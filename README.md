# ⭕ Sphere Volume Calculator

This project contains a simple JavaScript code to calculate the volume of a sphere based on its radius input by the user.

## Description

The code prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere, calculates the volume using the formula:

V = (4/3) * PI * radius³

Where:
- `V` is the volume of the sphere.
- `PI` is the mathematical constant (π).
- `radius` is the radius of the sphere, provided by the user.

The result is then displayed in an alert message showing the volume of the sphere.

## How to Use

1. Run the script in a web browser that supports JavaScript.
2. The script will prompt the user to enter the radius of the sphere.
3. The volume of the sphere will be calculated and displayed in an alert box.

## Example

If the user enters `3` as the radius, the output will be something like:

The volume of the sphere is: V = (4/3) * PI * 3³, therefore a sphere with radius 3 has a volume of 113.097.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- `Math.PI` for the value of π
- `Math.pow()` for raising the radius to the power of 3
